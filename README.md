### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
 
I am Kartik. You can find out more about my work, interests and life on [my personal website](https://kartiktiwari.in/)

- ðŸ”­ I work on computational astrophysics, philosophy of physics and formal systems. 
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am predicting polarization signatures from neutron stars observations. I also spend considerable time learning about Numerical Relativity.
- ðŸ‘¯ If you have an interesting project idea related to astrophysics or computational philosophy (mainly formal logic, time and linguistics), do reach out to me.
- ðŸ“« Best way to contact me is to send me an email. I rarely check messages on my social media. 

Finally, I maintain a [public reading list](https://kartiktiwari.notion.site/3617ac542318400eb9b9c650c2f071fe?v=662692b58eed4e5cbd3401c5d8d0be46) which you might find interesting.
